## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of trust and reliability. The choice of blue reflects the established and professional nature of J M PlastoPack Pvt. Ltd, steering clear of overly modern or playful color schemes.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), subtly desaturated, to ensure content readability and reduce eye strain in prolonged use.  The light tint retains the seriousness needed for an Enterprise application, as reflected by the dark color scheme
- Accent color: A subdued violet (#9575CD), analogous to blue, used sparingly to highlight interactive elements and important data points, maintaining a cohesive and professional visual hierarchy. Should be significantly brighter than the background to assure a good contrast.
- Use a clean, sans-serif font for all text elements to ensure readability and maintain a professional look.
- Employ simple, recognizable icons from lucide-react to aid navigation and highlight key actions. The icon set must follow a consistent style, with sufficient contrast and without distracting color.
- Implement a clean, intuitive layout with clear sections for easy navigation. Use a consistent grid system to maintain a balanced and responsive design.
